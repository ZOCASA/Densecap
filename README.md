# Densecap
Modified Densecap

Given a video, extracts frames from it, then run DenseCap on them individually.

To run:
<code>./helper_dc.sh path_to_video [options for densecap]</code>

<p>
TODO:</br>
1 > Currently no check for argument.</br>
2 > Not removing directories.
</p>

Also added an additional option to prebuilt DenseCap model.
